A hack for DFW! 

# About The Proect
Have you seen an outfit online and wanted to try it on but felt too lazy to go the store? Well now you can "try on" clothing in the comfort of your own home.  All you need is a web cam and a face! 

This hack utilizes tracker.js to recognize faces.  From there, regular javascript is used to determine the coordinates for the outfit.  The hack also uses HTML and CSS as well.  

# Things Left To Improve On 
- Need to figure out scaling 
- Fix minor bugs on outfits
